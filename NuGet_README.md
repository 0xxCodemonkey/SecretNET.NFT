# Secret.NET SNIP721 / Secret NFT
**Secret.NET SNIP721** is a layer on top of the [**SecretNET client**](https://github.com/0xxCodemonkey/SecretNET) (for the Secret Network Blockchain) which supports all methods of the reference implementation of the SNIP721 contract:
- Implementation => [GitHub - baedrik/snip721-reference-impl](https://github.com/baedrik/snip721-reference-impl) 
- Implementation of the [SNIP-721 specification](https://github.com/SecretFoundation/SNIPs/blob/master/SNIP-721.md) and [SNIP-722 specification](https://github.com/baedrik/snip-722-spec/blob/master/SNIP-722.md).
- See also the [SNIP721 documentation on Secret Network](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/development/snips/snip-721-private-non-fungible-tokens-nfts).

:white_check_mark: **This repository is explicitly intended to serve as a template for custom SNIP721 token contracts.** 
This makes it easy to create your own customized clients for your own customized contracts.
Of course, the concept can be used for any kind of smart contracts in general.
