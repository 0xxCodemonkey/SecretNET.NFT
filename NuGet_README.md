# Secret.NET SNIP721 / Secret NFT
**Secret.NET SNIP721** is a layer on top of the [**Secret.NET client**](https://github.com/0xxCodemonkey/SecretNET) which supports all methods of the reference implementation of the SNIP721 contract:
- Implementation => [GitHub - baedrik/snip721-reference-impl](https://github.com/baedrik/snip721-reference-impl) 
- Implementation of the [SNIP-721 specification](https://github.com/SecretFoundation/SNIPs/blob/master/SNIP-721.md) and [SNIP-722 specification](https://github.com/baedrik/snip-722-spec/blob/master/SNIP-722.md).
- See also the [SNIP721 documentation on Secret Network](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/development/snips/snip-721-private-non-fungible-tokens-nfts).

The [Secret Network blockchain](https://scrt.network/) (L1 / Cosmos), is the first privacy smart contract blockchain that processes and stores data on-chain in encrypted form (via Intel SGX). 
This allows [unique use cases](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/secret-network-overview/use-cases) like Secret NFTs where you can store public and private data e.g., Encryption Keys, passwords or other secrets. 

All information and documentation is available in the [**GitHub repository**](https://github.com/0xxCodemonkey/SecretNET.SNIP721).

:white_check_mark: **This repository is explicitly intended to serve as a template for custom SNIP721 token contracts.** 
This makes it easy to create your own customized clients for your own customized contracts.
Of course, the concept can be used for any kind of smart contracts in general.
